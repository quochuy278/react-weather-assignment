# Weather App

This project is developed as an assignment by the QT group. The Weather App is a web application that provides basic functionality to display weather data in Oulu (Finland). It presents the weather information in a tabular format and also offers data visualization using Highcharts. Additionally, clicking on any row in the table will navigate you to a detailed page showing the weather data for that specific day.

## Features

- Display weather data in Oulu in a tabular format.
- Visualize weather data using Highcharts.
- Clicking on a table row navigates to a detailed page for that specific day's weather data.

## Drawbacks

- Limited to displaying weather data for Oulu only.
- The app lacks advanced features such as search functionality for other locations, customizable display options, and extended weather forecasts.

## Improvements

- Expand the app to support multiple locations, allowing users to view weather data for different cities.
- Implement a search feature that enables users to search for weather information in their desired location.
- Enhance the user interface with more interactive elements, such as tooltips or animations, to improve the overall user experience.
- Provide extended weather forecasts, including hourly forecasts and multi-day forecasts.
- Integrate real-time data updates to ensure the displayed weather information is always up to date.
- Implement user preferences,such as language selection.
